### 2-6 September 2019, Brussels, Belgium
## Course Scope

The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (www.scar.org) is pleased to partner with the rOpenSci project and the Antarctic Biodiversity Portal (www.biodiversity.aq) in organising a short course on tools for Southern Ocean spatial analysis and modelling using R.
This course will teach participants how to retrieve, model and interpret species occurrence data from the Southern Ocean using R-tools developed through the Antarctic R community. In hands-on sessions, participants will learn how to find, download and clean data using R packages and how to display these data on Antarctic (polar projection) maps. The course will introduce various ways of analyzing the data including Species Distribution Modelling (SDM).

## Course Objectives

Our aim is that by the end of the course students will be equipped to:

- Set up a workflow for the retrieval, cleaning and analysis of Southern Ocean biological data
- Learn which R packages can be used to do this
- Learn about species distribution models and how to develop them
- Apply these new insights to their own data.

## Course Instructors

<img src="/images/Anton.jpeg" alt="Anton" title="Anton" width="75"  align="left"/> Anton Van de Putte (Royal Belgian Institute for Natural Sciences, KULeuven) manages the SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal and is a strong advocate of FAIR data and reproducible science. You can ask him questions about biological open data standards and data cleaning.

<img src="/images/Ben.jpg" alt="Ben" title="Ben" width="75"  align="right"/> Ben Raymond (Australian Antarctic Division and the University of Tasmania) is a data-focused research scientist working across a range of Antarctic and Southern Ocean science. He is a co-proponent of the SCAR/rOpenSci R community initiative (https://scar.github.io/ropensci/)

<img src="/images/Charlene.jpg" alt="Charlene" title="Charlene" width="75"  align="left"/> Charl√®ne Guillaumot (ULB, Bruxelles) is an ecological modeller.She studies the potential and limits of species distribution models and dynamic energy budget models on Southern Ocean case studies, and develops/adapts methodologies according to the encountered issues. 

<img src="/images/Grant.jpg" alt="Grant" title="Grant" width="75"  align="right"/>Grant Humphries (director Black Bawks Data Science ltd, Fort Augustus, Scotland) is a seabird biologist and data scientist who has worked on terrestrial and marine ecosystems with a focus on applying machine learning to complex ecosystems. You can chat with Grant about creating decision support tools in R and Python, and what his favourite programming language is.

<img src="/images/Huw.jpg" alt="Huw" title="Huw" width="75"  align="left"/> Huw Griffith (British Antarctic Survey) is a marine biologist who studies large-scale biogeographic and ecological patterns in space and time. He uses selected groups of animals to investigate trends in distribution in the Polar Regions, utilising large biological and physical databases to understand key processes.


## Course Length

The first part of the course (3 days)  will focus on introducing various R packages and overall workflows. The second part of the course (2 days) will be a hands-on opportunity for participants to work on their own data with the assistance of the course instructors. You can choose to only register for the first part of the course if you prefer.
The course is targeting Polar Early Career scientists, but is open to any other research students or scientists that require these skills for their work. There is space for a maximum of 20 participants.


## Requirements

Some experience in the computer language R is desirable, and experience with GIS is helpful. All participants must bring their own personal laptop.
If you are not sure if your experience in R is sufficient, you should follow the one of the free online courses below:

## Language

English

## Code of Conduct

To ensure a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates, we have a strict [code of conduct](coc.md) that all participants are expected to follow.

## Fees and Funding

There is a 75 euro registration fee for the course.
The fee include full participation in the course, and digital copies of the course material, as well as coffee breaks and a small lunch.
Participants will need to arrange their own travel and accommodation, but limited travel support will be available in collaboration with the [SCAR Ant-Eco](https://www.scar.org/science/anteco/home/) research program.

## Registration

Deadline for applications is Friday June 15th. After this date you will be notified of the offer of a place and sent an invoice for the course fee. The deadline for payment is Friday 7th July 2018. Failure to pay will lead to your place being offered to someone else.
