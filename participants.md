<img src="/images/participants/HenrikChristiansen.jpg" alt="Henrik" title="Henrik" width="75"  align="left"/> Henrik Christiansen is a marine biologist currently pursuing a PhD at KU Leuven, Belgium. As part of a national Antarctic research program he investigates the connectivity and adaptation of Southern Ocean fish. His current project relies heavily on molecular and bioinformatics work to elucidate genomic variability within populations. Several research cruises are part of his field experience, the latest one heading towards the Antarctic Peninsula with a sailboat.

### Davide	Di Franco, Germany

### Regan	Drennan, United Kingdom

### Prem	Gill, United Kingdom

### Sian	Henley,	United Kingdom
<img src="/images/participants/SianHenley.jpg" alt="Sian" title="Sian" width="75"  align="left"/>I am a marine biogeochemist interested in how ocean physics and biology affect biogeochemistry - and how biogeochemical properties and processes affect ecosystem functioning - over a range of spatial and temporal scales. During this course, I hope to improve my skills in spatial analysis and modelling using large biogeochemical datasets relevant to ecology.

### Andrew	Lowther,	Norway

### Ana Laura	Machado,	Uruguay
<img src="/images/participants/AnaLauraMachado.JPG" alt="Ana Laura" title="Ana Laura" width="75"  align="left"/>Ana Laura	Machado is a biologist, interested in studying the effects of climate change and the anthropic impact on the physiology, behavior and distribution of Antarctic penguins. See is keen on learning more about the models of species distribution and how to develop them.

### Sarah	Maes, Belgium

### Camila	Neder, Germany
<img src="/images/participants/CamilaNeder.jpg" alt="Camila" title="Camila" width="75"  align="left"/> I am  a biologist working in collaboration with the Functional Ecology Modeling group at Alfred Wegener Institut-Germany on understanding the transport of suspended particulate matter which is dragged into the water system due glacier retreat and coastal erosion, and has been shown it is a crucial factor for benthic species distribution models at the area. Apart from my passion to see the full picture of the system, the sea, the biology and ecology; I like to be outside in the nature, team sports, moon photography and international cultural exchanges.

### Hendrik	Pehlke, Germany

### Alice	Pullen, United Kingdom

### Stephanie	Roy,	Canada
<img src="/images/participants/StephanieRoy.jpg" alt="Stephanie" title="Stephanie" width="75"  align="right"/>I am particularly interested in food web dynamics in a changing Southern Ocean. I want to understand how the interactions between species are affected by different type of disturbances and how these pressures could create a shift in the ecosystem in future years. 

### Hanieh	Saeedi, Germany

### Louraine	Salabao, Belgium

### Fokje	Schaafsma,	The Netherlands

### Katharina	Teschke, Germany

### Daniela	Thorne,	Peru
<img src="/images/participants/DanielaThorne.jpg" alt="Daniela	Thorne" title="Daniela	Thorne" width="75"  align="left"/>My main interest is the conservation ecology on the marine realm. I am study the distribution of some groups of Antarctic Sessile Suspension feeders (SSf) inside Mackellar inlet, a fjord in Admiralty bay. 
Some SSf are three-dimensional habitat providers, and indicators of environmental change they can be used as a surrogate tool for identifying vulnerable marine ecosystems.
I would also like to predict their possible habitats, or how they will react to climatic changes.
