### 2-6 september 2019
## Course Scope

The Scientific Committee on Antarctic research (www.scar.org) is pleased to partner with the rOpenSci project and the Antarctic Biodiversity Portal (www.biodiversity.aq) in organising a short course on tools for Southern Ocean spatial analysis and modelling using R.
This course will teach participants how to retrieve, model and interpret species distribution data from the Southern Ocean using R-tools developed through the Antarctic R community. In hands-on sessions, participants will learn how to find, download and clean data using R-packages and how to place these distribution data on Antarctic (polar projection) maps. The course will introduce various ways of analyzing the distribution data including  Species Distribution Modeling (SDM). 

## Course Objectives
In the end of the course our aim is that the students will be equipped to
Set up a workflow for the retrieval, cleaning and analysis of Southern Ocean Biological data
Learn which R-packages can be used to do this.
Learn about species distribution models and how to develop them
Apply these new insight to their own data.

## Course length
The first part of the course (3 days)  will focus on introducing various R packages, and overall workflows. The second part of the course (2 days) is hands on, participants will be able to work on their own data with assistance of the course instructors. You can choose to only register for the first part of the course.
The course is targeting Polar Early Career scientist, and is open to any other research students or scientist that require these skills for their work. There is place for a maximum of 20 participants.


## Requirements
Some experience in the computer language R is desirable, and experience with GIS is helpful. All participants must bring their own personal laptop.
If you are not sure if your experience in R is sufficient, you should follow the one of the free online course below:

## Fees and Funding
There is a 75 euro registration fee for the course.
The fee include full participation in the course, and digital copies of the course material, as well as Coffee breaks and a small lunch.
Participants will have to arrange their own travel and accommodation, but limited travel support will be available in collaboration with Ent-Eco.
